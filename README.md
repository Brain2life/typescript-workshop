## What is TypeScript?

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** (or **TS**) is a free, open-source programming language created by Microsoft. It builds on JavaScript by adding static typing, which means you can define the types of variables and functions to catch errors early - before your code runs.

TypeScript is especially helpful for building large and complex applications. It doesn’t run directly in browsers or servers, so it needs to be **transformed into JavaScript** first - a process called **transpiling**. You can use the built-in TypeScript Compiler for this, or use tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

You can write TypeScript for both **front-end (browser)** and **back-end (server)** development, using platforms like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Deno](https://deno.com/), or [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
